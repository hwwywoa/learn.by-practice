The time has come to an end
Yeah â€“ this is what nature planned
Being tracked by a starving beast
Looking for it's daily feast
A predator on the verge of death
Close to its last breath
Getting close to it's last breath
RULES OF NATURE
And they run when the sun comes up
With their lives on the line (ALIVE)
For all that I've
(No choice)
Gotta follow the laws of the wild (ALIVE)
